We work on scalable techniques to generate a large number of valid binaries to provide a good 
valuation dataset for all binary analysis tasks, e.g., type inference, function boundary detection, CFG recovery, etc.


## Datasets

Our techniques have created the following binary datasets:

### [Cornucopia dataset](./projects/cornucopia)

## Current Projects

Please refer to [our projects page](./projects/) for the list of projects and their details.
